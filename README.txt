1. We are encrypting the communication between (4)->(5) and the forward from (5)->(6)

2. We ensure that the item was purchased at the correct Buy Price by storing
the price directly within the session through a post request and securely
connecting to the server through SSL when this post request is done.

3. In order to guarantee that you can't scroll horizontally I
have added the width="device-width" to the meta tag.

4. To guarantee the width of the text box component fits,
we add a css file that will only be read when a mobile site
is detected and then set the width to auto for that case.
